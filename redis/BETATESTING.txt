Hello betatester!

This Redis Server distribution is just a preview, it is by no mean an usable
product, but probably it can already give you some feeling about what the
final release is going to be.

DON'T USE THIS CODE IN PRODUCTION, IT MAY RUN YOUR APPLICATION, DELETE ALL YOUR
DATA, HANG YOUR SERVERS. Don't use it for real work.

Please send feedbacks to antirez at gmail dot com.

Enjoy,
antirez
