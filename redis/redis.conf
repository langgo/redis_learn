# Redis configuration file example

# Close the connection after a client is idle for N seconds
timeout 300

# Save the DB on disk:
#
#   save <seconds> <changes>
#
#   Will save the DB if both the given number of seconds and the given
#   number of write operations against the DB occurred.
#
#   In the example below the behaviour will be to save:
#   after 900 sec (15 min) if at least 1 key changed
#   after 300 sec (5 min) if at least 10 keys changed
#   after 60 sec if at least 10000 keys changed
save 900 1
save 300 10
save 60 10000

# For default save/load DB in/from the working directory
# Note that you must specify a directory not a file name.
dir ./

# Set server verbosity to 'debug'
# it can be one of:
# debug (a lot of information, useful for development/testing)
# notice (moderately verbose, what you want in production probably)
# warning (only very important / critical messages are logged)
loglevel debug

# Specify the log file name. Also 'stdout' can be used to force
# the demon to log on the standard output.
logfile stdout

# Set the number of databases.
databases 16
